Welcome to my profile, I currently work at Microsoft and you can that work here: https://github.com/wizimmer (but it's mostly private). This account is for my personal projects and contributions. I enjoy solving complex problems with kubernetes and machine learning. Currently refreshing my knowledge of numpy. Reach out if there is something I could help on!
